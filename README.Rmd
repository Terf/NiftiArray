The goal of `niftiArray` is to allow for memory efficient fast random access of NIfTI objects. `niftiArray` is an R package that allows for convenient and memory-efficient containers for on-disk representation of NIfTI objects. We allow for DelayedArray extensions and support all operations supported by DelayedArray objects. These operations can be either delayed or block-processed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `niftiArray` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("muschellij2/niftiArray")
```

We are working to get a stable version on [Neuroconductor](www.neuroconductor.org).
